## Description

DISCLAIMER - This policy works when all resources of type aws_s3_bucket, aws_s3_bucket_versioning and aws_s3_bucket_server_side_encryption_configuration are present in the root module.

This control checks whether an Amazon S3 general purpose bucket is encrypted with an AWS KMS key (SSE-KMS or DSSE-KMS). The control fails if the bucket is encrypted with default encryption (SSE-S3).

Server-side encryption (SSE) is the encryption of data at its destination by the application or service that receives it. Unless you specify otherwise, S3 buckets use Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) by default for server-side encryption.

This rule is covered by the [s3-bucket-should-be-encrypted-at-rest](https://github.com/hashicorp/policy-library-NIST-Policy-Set-for-AWS-Terraform/blob/main/policies/s3/s3-bucket-should-be-encrypted-at-rest.sentinel) policy.
